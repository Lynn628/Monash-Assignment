        <p><b>Q. What is involved in being a franchisee with our Coffee shop?</b></p>
        <p>
            <b>Answer:</b>
            "Owning your own franchise is a hands-on job; from recruiting staff to serving customers and making coffees to closing up at the end of the day, stock ordering and doing wages to name a few.
It’s all part of running a successful business and a very rewarding experience if pursued with the right passion and business acumen."
